My path to becoming a software engineer was somewhat non-traditional. I studied 
chemistry üß™ at Imperial College London, graduating with a masters, a <a href="https://www.pnas.org/doi/full/10.1073/pnas.1903500116" 
title="Building a synthetic mechanosensitive signaling pathway in compartmentalized artificial cells">
publication</a>, and new found respect for anyone wanting to spend their 
career working full time in a science lab. I knew it wasn't the option for me,
and so I looked elsewhere and landed a space on the Technology Graduate Program 
at üè¶ Deutsche Bank. Not knowing much about either technology or Investment
Banking, I jumped into it with lots of enthusiasm.
<br></br>
<br></br>
Half way through my second 6 month rotation however, I started second guessing
my decisions. You see I had actually been hired as a Technical Business Analyst,
a role which I never knew existed, and while <span>
  "being the bridge between the business and the developers"
</span> sounded interesting on paper, in reality I spent my days looking at gant
charts, sitting in meetings, and emailing spreadsheets around. The final push I
needed came in the form of a 3 month stint in Group Audit. I knew I couldn't do
this for the rest of my working life.
<br></br>
<br></br>
It definitely wasn't all doom and gloom however. I met fantastic people and really
talanted engineers, product owners and team leaders, as well as other graduates from
the cohort who have become great friends, got to see the inner workings of a <strong>
very large </strong> corporate (to the best of my knowledge there were ~10,000 engineers and
~80,000 total employees) and those 9 months helped me realise what I don't want to
do, and ultimately led me to what I <span>do want</span> to do - Software Engineering.
<br></br>
<br></br>
I was fortunate that my personal realisation coincided with a wider
movement in the bank to retain technical resources, and enrich their technical
skills. I was able to leave my Business Analayst role - and therefore the whole
graduate scheme - 3 months early and transition into a new team, where my new
role would be a <span>‚ú® Junior Software Engineer ‚ú®.</span> To this day I am still
amazed and grateful that I landed this position, because it was here that I laid
a foundation of knowledge which catapulted me in my journey. It was a
combination of factors that made this experience so valuable:
<ul>
  <li>
    üë®‚Äçüè´ A super technical manager, who dedicated some of his precious time to
    explain basic concepts like REST APIs, MVC architecture and Unit testing. We
    would spend our 1-1's aroud a white board, and I would come with a list of
    questions from things I had read that week. No question was stupid, and at
    no time did I feel uncomforatable for my severe lack of knowledge.
  </li>
  <li>
    üçï A small team, meaning I touched all parts of the tech stack. I would go on
    to write backend logic, build new front end compoentns, set up the apps
    first automated build and deployment pipeline (I wouldn't go as far as
    calling it full CI/CD though!), run user sessions and helping prioritise
    sprints. Later on when a more senior developer joined the team, he would
    lead a full re-write of the front end in Angular, which I got to see first
    hand, and later contribute new features to.
  </li>
  <li>
    ‚è≤Ô∏è Perhaps what turned out to be most useful - when I joined the team was in a
    re-org phase, meaning it would be some time (it was a huge corporate after
    all!) until our priorities were set in stone. In the mean time I would be
    working on a legacy, internal application aimed at improving the DevEx
    experience across the bank, that many people wanted, but no team had
    resources to rebuild or maintian.
  </li>
</ul>
By the time the team pivoted into its long-term objective (
<span>which would be adopting cloud technology through the bank</span>) I had
gained experience in a ton of new tools - Java, SpringBoot, Angular, Jenkins,
Kubernetes (on OpenShift), Helm, MariaDB, MySQL - as well as core concepts like
Git, using the command line, Agile ceremonies and practices, doing demos and
presentations, writing blog posts and building a community around a shared
platform.
